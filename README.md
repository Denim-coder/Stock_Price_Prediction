📈 Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
Predicting stock price movement using supervised machine learning algorithms and financial market data.

🚀 Project Overview
This project aims to predict next-day stock price movement (up or down) using historical stock market data. It leverages various machine learning techniques to build a binary classification model that determines whether the closing price of a stock will rise the next day.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python 3.x

Pandas, NumPy — data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn — data visualization

Scikit-learn — machine learning algorithms and preprocessing

XGBoost — gradient boosting classifier

Jupyter Notebook / Colab — interactive development

📊 Dataset
The dataset includes historical daily stock prices for Tesla (Tesla.csv). It typically contains the following columns:

Date

Open, High, Low, Close

Volume

📌 You can replace this with any stock data downloaded from Yahoo Finance, Kaggle, or Quandl.

🧠 Features & Target
Engineered Features:

day, month, year extracted from Date

is_quarter_end — indicates if the date is quarter-end

Price columns: Open, High, Low, Close, Volume

Target Variable:

target = 1 if next day's Close > current day's Close, else 0

📌 Workflow
Load and clean data
